CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

During start, gst123 will read ~/.gst123rc, if this file exists. Empty lines
and lines starting with a # are ignored. The following commands are available:

audio_output <driver>[=<device>]::
    This sets the default audio driver and the default audio device.  It has
    the same effect as the -a / --audio-output command line option.  When both
    are present, a config file  entry  and  the command line option, the value
    from the command line option will be used. Read the section on audio
    drivers for details on the available drivers and syntax.

visualization <visualization_plugin>::
    Set default visualization plugin for audio files. This setting has the same
    effect as the -v / --visualization command line option. When both are
    present, the value from the command line option will be used.

AUDIO DRIVERS
-------------
alsa=<device>::
    The  ALSA  driver; when used without argument (as in -a alsa), the ALSA
    driver uses the default device. To select an ALSA device, its possible to
    use for example alsa=hw:1 (which will use the hw:1 ALSA device).

oss=<device>::
    The OSS driver; when used without argument (as in -a oss), the OSS driver
    uses the default device. The device can be specified using for example
    oss=/dev/dsp1 (which would use the OSS  device /dev/dsp1).

pulse=<device>::
    The PulseAudio driver. This driver optionally accepts a device name using
    the pulse=<device> syntax.

jack::
    The JACK driver. Device selection is not supported in this case.

none::
    Dummy output driver, will not output any audio.
