CONFIGURATION FILE


.PP

During start, gst123 will read ~/.gst123rc, if this file exists. Empty
lines and lines starting with a # are ignored. The following commands are
available:
.br

.br



.TP
\fBaudio_output\fP \fI<driver>[=<device>]\fP
.br
This sets the default audio driver (which may be oss, alsa or jack) and the
default audio device (which may be something like /dev/dsp1 for the oss
driver or an alsa device like hw:1 for the alsa driver), and has the
same effect as the \-a / \-\-audio\-output command line option. When both
are present, a config file entry and the command line option, the
value from the command line option will be used.
