.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

During start, gst123 will read ~/.gst123rc, if this file exists. Empty lines and lines starting with a # are ignored. The following commands are available:
.TP
\fBaudio_output\fR \fI<driver>[=<device>]\fR
This sets the default audio driver and the default audio device. It has the same effect as the -a / --audio-output command line option. When both are present, a config file entry and the command line option, the value from the command line option will be used. Read the section on audio drivers for details on the available drivers and syntax.
.PP
.TP
\fBvisualization\fR \fI<visualization_plugin>\fR
Set default visualization plugin for audio files. This setting has the same effect as the -v / --visualization command line option. When both are present, the value from the command line option will be used.
.PP

.SH AUDIO DRIVERS
.TP
\fBalsa\fR=[\fI<device>\fR]
The ALSA driver; when used without argument (as in -a alsa), the ALSA driver uses the default device. To select an ALSA device, its possible to use for example alsa=hw:1 (which will use the hw:1 ALSA device).
.PP
.TP
\fBjack\fR
The JACK driver. Device selection is not supported in this case.
.PP
.TP
\fBnone\fR
Dummy output driver, will not output any audio.
.PP
.TP
\fBoss\fR=[\fI<device>\fR]
The OSS driver; when used without argument (as in -a oss), the OSS driver uses the default device. The device can be specified using for example oss=/dev/dsp1 (which would use the OSS device /dev/dsp1).
