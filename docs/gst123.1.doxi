@item @manb{-v}, @manb{--version} @*
	Prints out @manb{gst123} version.
@item @manb{-v}, @manb{--full-version} @*

@item @manb{-r}, @manb{--repeat} @*
        Repeat playlist forever.
@item @manb{-z}, @manb{--shuffle} @*
        Shuffle playlist before playing.
@item @manb{-Z}, @manb{--random} @*
        Play files in random order forever.
@item @manb{-x}, @manb{--novideo} @*
        Do not play the video stream.
@item @manb{-@@} @mani{<playlist>}, @manb{--list} @mani{<playlist>} @*
        Load files to play from the playlist file.
@item @manb{-a}, @manb{--audio-output} @mani{<driver>[=<device>]} @*

@done
       Besides filenames, playlist entries or command line args can be
       directories. In this case, gst123 recursively searches the directory and
       plays all files contained in it.
@heading INTERRUPT
       You  can  abort  gst123  at any time by pressing Ctrl-C.  If you are
       playing multiple files, this will stop the current file and begin playing the
       next one.  If you want to abort playing immediately instead of skipping to the
       next file, press Ctrl-C within the first second of the playback of a new file.

@heading CONFIGURATION FILE

During start, gst123 will read ~/.gst123rc, if this file exists. Empty
lines and lines starting with a # are ignored. The following commands are
available:

@itemize{none}
@item @manb{audio_output} @mani{<driver>[=<device>]}@*
    This sets the default audio driver and the default audio device.
    It has the same effect as the -a / --audio-output command line option.
    When both are present, a config file entry and the command line option,
    the value from the command line option will be used. Read the section
    on audio drivers for details on the available drivers and syntax.
@done

@heading AUDIO DRIVERS

@itemize{none}
@item @manb{alsa=[<device>]}@*
    The ALSA driver; when used without argument (as in -a alsa), the ALSA
    driver uses the default device. To select an ALSA device, its possible to
    use for example alsa=hw:1 (which will use the hw:1 ALSA device).
@item @manb{jack}@*
    The JACK driver. Device selection is not supported in this case.
@item @manb{none}@*
    Dummy output driver, will not output any audio.
@item @manb{oss=[<device>]}@*
    The OSS driver; when used without argument (as in -a oss), the OSS
    driver uses the default device. The device can be specified using for
    example oss=/dev/dsp1 (which would use the OSS device /dev/dsp1).
