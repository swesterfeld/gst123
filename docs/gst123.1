Besides filenames, playlist entries or command line args can be
directories. In this case, gst123 recursively searches the directory and
plays all files contained in it.

.PP
You can abort gst123 at any time by pressing Ctrl\-C. If you are
playing multiple files, this will stop the current file and begin playing the
next one. If you want to abort playing immediately instead of skipping to the
next file, press Ctrl\-C within the first second of the playback of a new file.

CONFIGURATION FILE


.PP

During start, gst123 will read ~/.gst123rc, if this file exists. Empty
lines and lines starting with a # are ignored. The following commands are
available:
.br

.br



.TP
\fBaudio_output\fP \fI<driver>[=<device>]\fP
.br
This sets the default audio driver (which may be oss, alsa or jack) and the
default audio device (which may be something like /dev/dsp1 for the oss
driver or an alsa device like hw:1 for the alsa driver), and has the
same effect as the \-a / \-\-audio\-output command line option. When both
are present, a config file entry and the command line option, the
value from the command line option will be used.
